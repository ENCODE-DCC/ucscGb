target AP-2alpha
antibodyDescription Rabbit polyclonal - AP-2alpha (H-79) is a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against amino acids 130-209 mapping within an internal region of AP-2alpha of human origin.
targetDescription Sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that interacts with inducible viral and cellular enhancer elements to regulate transcription of selected genes.  AP-2 factors bind to the consensus sequence 5' -GCCNNNGGC-3' and activate genes involved in a large spectrum of important biological functions including proper eye, face, body wall, limb and neural tube development.  They also suppress a number of genes including MCAM/MUC18, C/EBP alpha and MYC.  AP-2alpha is the only AP-2 protein required for early morphogenesis of the lens vesicle (by similarity).
